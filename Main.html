Several types of microchips are made today. Microprocessors are logic chips that perform the computations inside most commercial computers. Memory chips store information. Digital signal processors convert between analog and digital signals. Application-specific integrated circuits are special-purpose chips used in things such as cars and appliances.</p>

The creation of a complex microchip is a long, multi-step process. It involves creating the purest possible silicon, and then using incredibly precise machinery to create layer after layer of circuit pathways. If you've ever wondered why processors are so expensive, this explaination of the process should clear that up. </p>

<h1 align="left">III. Making  of a compact disc  </h1>

<p style="font-family:Verdana" align="left">
A compact disc, or CD, is an optical storage medium with digital data recorded on it. The digital data can be in the form of audio, video, or computer information. When the CD is played, the information is read or detected by a tightly focused light source called a laser (thus the name optical medium). This article will focus on audio compact discs, which are used to play back recorded music.
By the late 1970s, a common set of standards for the optical storage discs had been developed by the joint efforts of Sony and Philips. A consortium of 35 hardware manufacturers agreed to adopt this standard in 1981 and the first compact discs and compact disc players were introduced in the market in 1982.</p>
