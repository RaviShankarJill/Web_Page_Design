The creation of a complex microchip is a long, multi-step process. It involves creating the purest possible silicon, and then using incredibly precise machinery to create layer after layer of circuit pathways. If you've ever wondered why processors are so expensive, this explaination of the process should clear that up. <hr color="black"/>

<h2 style="color:white">Finding The Silicon :</h2>
The story starts with silica, or SiO2. This compound is found mainly in every day sand. The first step involves getting a supply of raw silica and sending it through the first of several refining stages. This first step creates a metallurgical-grade silicon. Raw silica is dropped into an electric arc furnace that contains some source of carbon, such as coal or even wood. It is then heated to 2000 C, and a chemical reaction takes place that frees the silicon from it's oxygen bedfellows. We are then left with metallurgical-grade silicon. <br/><br/>

Metallurgical grade might be pure enough for a chemistry lab, but not for chip manufactuers. That's where the next refining step takes place. This is obviously a more complex process than the simple production of silicon above. Over the years, it's been discovered that the best way to create the purest silicon is to convert it into a silicon-containing compound, such as Trichlorosilane, and then converting it back into silicon through various reactions. This works by supplying a rod of pure silicon from a previous refinement and subjecting it to Trichlorosilane vapors at high temperatures. The gas decomposes, leaving more and more pure silicon on the rod, resulting in only one impurity per billion parts.

Microchip companies can't use plain chunks of super-pure silicon, they need a giant, single crystal of silicon. This crystal, called an ingot, is formed in another giant furnace. The pure silicon chunks are tossed into a crucible in the furnace and a single silicon crystal connected to a robotic arm is installed above it. The furnace is turned on to 1500 C and the silicon melts. The arm dips the silicon seed in the molten material and pulls it in and out, creating layer after layer of perfect crystal. Eventually, we are left with an ingot that is slightly larger than 300mm and around 6 feet long. These ingots are then brought to a high precision later that rounds off the rougher edges on the crystal so that it is perfectly straight and exactly 300mm in diameter. From there, the ingot is cut using a diamond saw into wafers that are around .75mm thick. These wafers are then polished and sold to microchip companies. A 300mm wafer costs $3,000! Once these wafers arrive at a computer chip fabrication facility, the real fun begins. The environment  that these chips are made in are the cleanest known to man. In fact, the air at a chip fab is over 1000 times more pure than that of a hospital. Since this process is so complex, only the main points will be outlined.<br><br>

<h1 style="color:white">Photolithography</h1>
<img src="../images/photolithography.jpg" alt="photolithography" align="right" border="5" width="350" height="300">
The creation of a microchip is centered around the idea of photolithography. The company recieves a silicon wafer and puts it into their manufacturing devices. The start of the photolithography process involves coating the silicon with a layer of photoresist chemical. The critical property of this chemical is that it becomes gooey and easy to remove when exposed to ultraviolet light, while those parts that haven't been exposed remain solid. A stencil is placed over the wafer and a UV light is turned on. The light can only reach the wafer through the openings in the stencil, causing the photoresist to change only in specific spots. Once the photoresist has reacted with the UV light, it is easy to remove at those specific places. That leaves parts of the wafer's silicon exposed, and other parts protected by unreacted photoresist. Various acids etch away the exposed silicon, and then specific solvents remove the remaining photoresist. What's left is a pattern on the wafer that is the exact opposite of the pattern on the original stencil. A layer of silicon dioxide is then added, which acts as an insulator between layers on a chip, and then polysilicon, which acts as a conductor between layers of a chip.
The same photoresist and stencil process is applied which leaves ridges of insulation and conduction for this layer of the chip. In order to change the various conductivity properties inside the silicon, the wafer is then exposed to a device that implants ions into specific locations on the wafer. This is known as ion implantation or doping. Once the proper levels of ions have been added, it is time to grow the second layer of the chip. This goes the same way as the first layer, with silicon being added, then a photoresist, etc. The second layer will connect to the first player at spots where there are polysilicon ridges and will be insulated from it at points where there are silicon dioxide ridges. Up to 20 layers are added to create a 3D chip design on the wafer. Each 300mm wafer will produce around 500 chips.

The overall process is obviously quite a bit more complex than was previously shown, but that is a general idea of what is going on. This brings us to the testing phase. The circuitry of every chip on the wafer is tested before the chips are even cut apart. Once defective chips have been established, the wafer is cut apart. The defective chips are trashed and those that passed the first test are packaged into the CPU packaging we see every day. These chips are then tested one final time to assure that the packaging process went smoothly, and then they are shipped off to wholesalers, who sell to businesses, who sell to you. The voyage that silicon makes from the beaches of california into your computer is long, tedious, and expensive. Going from two purification stages to creating $3,000 wafers to extensive pathway etching boggles the mind. However, this article has given you a basic idea of how long of a process this is, and hopefully has finally answered the question : “Why are CPUs so expensive?”
